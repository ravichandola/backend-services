# File Creation Policy

## Markdown Files (.md, .mdx, .mdc)

**NEVER create markdown files (README.md, documentation files, etc.) unless the user explicitly requests it.**

### Rules:
- ❌ **DO NOT** proactively create documentation files
- ❌ **DO NOT** create README.md files unless asked
- ❌ **DO NOT** create .md files for documentation unless explicitly requested
- ✅ **ONLY** create .md files when the user explicitly says:
  - "create a README"
  - "write documentation"
  - "create a .md file"
  - "document this"
  - "add documentation"
  - "create documentation"
  - "write a guide"
  - "add a README"
  - "document the API"
  - "create a markdown file for X"
  - "generate documentation"
  - "write docs"
  - or similar explicit requests that clearly indicate documentation intent

### Examples:

**❌ BAD - Don't do this:**
- After implementing a feature, automatically creating a README.md
- Creating documentation files "to help explain the code"
- Proactively creating .md files for new features

**✅ GOOD - Only do this when asked:**
- User says: "Create a README.md for this project"
- User says: "Document this API in a markdown file"
- User explicitly requests markdown file creation

### Exceptions (Allowed):
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files (rule files themselves)
- Configuration files required by project structure (e.g., `CHANGELOG.md` if part of workflow)
- Files explicitly requested by user (even if not explicitly saying "create .md file")
- When user asks "should I create a README?" - wait for explicit confirmation

### Borderline Cases (Ask First):
- User says: "This code needs documentation" → Ask: "Would you like me to create a documentation file?"
- User says: "Explain how this works" → Don't create .md file, just explain in response
- User says: "Document this feature" → Ask: "Should I create a markdown documentation file?"
